Allows animal to swim and move in water! This lightweight client-side script prevents land-based animal peds from drowning or ragdolling in water, applying smooth upward force and preserving immersion when players use animal models.

## üß† How It Works

When a player loads into the server, the script checks if their ped is an animal (`GetPedType(ped) == 28`). If so, it applies buoyancy logic every 200ms when the player is in water, not a vehicle. It prevents drowning, sinking, and bouncing too high in the water, giving a much more realistic feel for roleplay scenarios involving dogs or other animals.
