Allows animal to swim and move in water! This lightweight client-side script prevents land-based animal peds from drowning or ragdolling in water, applying smooth upward force and preserving immersion when players use animal models.

## ✨ Features

- Automatically detects if the player is using an animal ped
- Applies dynamic float behavior in deep and shallow water
- Prevents animal drowning by restoring health
- Disables ragdoll in water, re-enables on land
- Smooth transitions and force control for natural movement
- This does **not** modify or interfere with non-animal peds or vehicles.
- Great for K9 RP, wildlife servers, or animal mods.

## 🧠 How It Works

When a player loads into the server, the script checks if their ped is an animal (`GetPedType(ped) == 28`). If so, it applies buoyancy logic every 200ms when the player is in water, not a vehicle. It prevents drowning, sinking, and bouncing too high in the water, giving a much more realistic feel for roleplay scenarios involving dogs or other animals.

Optional: Use ox_lib for slight improvement of tracking ped changes
